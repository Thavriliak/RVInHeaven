<h1>RV In Heaven</h1>

Have you ever been traveling in your RV or camper and struggled to find a place to park for the night? Or perhaps you found a place to hook up to and staythe night, but you aren't satisfied with the facility. RV In Heaven is an application to fix that issue. 

RV In Heaven is a social application where users can post new and exciting experiences that they have had at recent campsites or RV parks and relate how much they loved--- or hated them! For traveling, this will be a critical asset for anyone on the run.

To build this application, I was able to implement vanilla JavaScript and JQuery on the front end and a relational database on the backend with Ruby on Rails. Users will be able to make new posts, and will also be able to comment on another users posts. Also, there will be a rating system where users will be able to see what the average "star" rating of a park or campsite may be. Also listed under the review will be a list of ammenities the park/site has to offer.
